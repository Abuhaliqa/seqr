xBrowse
=======

xBrowse is a software package for working with next generation sequencing data,
specifically in the context of studying rare genetic diseases.

This package contains the analysis code that powers the [xBrowse website](http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xbrowse), but 
we welcome anyone wishing to set up their own private instance of xBrowse.

**Please Note:** This package is in active development, and the API is extremely unstable. We suggest you contact us if you want to build on this repo.

## Installation Instructions

Currently we have 2 supported ways to install your own dev instance of xBrowse: 
0. For MacOSX laptop or desktop, see: [deploy/mac_osx/README.md](deploy/mac_osx/README.md)
0. For puppet-based installation on an Amazon EC2 server, see: [deploy/mac_osx/README.md](deploy/ec2/README-ec2.md)
