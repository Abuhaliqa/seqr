seqr is a web-based analysis tool for rare disease genomics.

This repository contains code that underlies the [Broad seqr instance](http://seqr.broadinstitute.org) and other seqr deployments.

## Technical Overview

seqr consists of the following components:
- seqr - the main client-server application. It consists of javascript + react.js on the client-side, python + django on the server-side.
- postgres - SQL database used by seqr and phenotips to store project metadata and user-generated content such as variant notes, etc.
- phenotips - 3rd-party web-based form for entering structured phenotype data.
- matchbox - a tool for connecting with the Match Maker Exchange.
- nginx - http server used as the main gateway between seqr and the internet.
- pipeline-runner - container for running hail pipelines to annotate and load new datasets.
- redis - in-memory cache used to speed up request handling.
- elasticsearch - NoSQL database used to store variant callsets.
- kibana - dashboard and visual interface for elasticsearch.
- mongo - legacy NoSQL database originally used for variant callsets and still used now to store logs.


## Install

seqr can be installed on a laptop or on-prem server(s) using installation scripts in the deploy/ directory:

## Updating / Migrating an older seqr Instance

For notes on how to update an older instance, see  

[Update/Migration Instructions](deploy/MIGRATE.md)


## Data loading pipelines

seqr uses [hail](http://hail.is)-based pipelines to run VEP and add in other reference data before loading them into elasticsearch.
These pipelines can be run locally on a single machine or on-prem spark cluster, or on a cloud-based spark cluster like Google Dataproc.
We are working on integrating these pipelines so that they are launched and managed by seqr.
For now, they must be run manually, as shown in the example below. 
See [hail_elasticsearch_pipelines](https://github.com/macarthur-lab/hail-elasticsearch-pipelines)
for additional documentation.
