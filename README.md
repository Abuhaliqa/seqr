seqr
====

seqr is a software package for working with next generation sequencing data,
specifically in the context of studying rare genetic diseases.

This package contains the analysis code that powers the [seqr website](http://seqr.broadinstitute.org), but 
we welcome anyone wishing to set up their own private instance of seqr.

**Please Note:** This package is in active development, and the API is extremely unstable. We suggest you contact us if you want to build on this repo.

## Installation Instructions

* seqr local install: [deploy/mac_osx/README.md](deploy/mac_osx/README.md)  
* Phenotips [install instructions](deploy/mac_osx/README_WITH_PHENOTIPS.md) that enable  [Phenotips](https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips) to be used to enter HPO-based phenotypes from within seqr.
