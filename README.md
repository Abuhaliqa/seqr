xBrowse
=======

xBrowse is a software package for working with next generation sequencing data,
specifically in the context of studying rare genetic diseases.

This package contains the analysis code that powers the [xBrowse website](http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xbrowse), but 
we welcome anyone wishing to set up their own private instance of xBrowse.

**Please Note:** This package is in active development, and the API is extremely unstable. We suggest you contact us if you want to build on this repo.

## Installation Instructions

Currently there are up-to-date instructions for installing a dev instance of xBrowse on your MacOSX laptop or desktop.  
See: [deploy/mac_osx/README.md](deploy/mac_osx/README.md)

We are also very close to completing (as of 2/5/2015) the code for a puppet-based automated deployment of xbrowse to a  vagrant virtual machine, or to an Amazon EC2 server.
