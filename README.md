xBrowse
=======

xBrowse is a software package for working with next generation sequencing data,
specifically in the context of studying rare genetic diseases.

This package contains the analysis code that powers the [xBrowse web app](http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xbrowse).
You are also welcome to set up a private instance of xBrowse on your own infrastructure.

**Please Note:** This package is in active development, and the API is extremely unstable. We suggest you contact us if you want to build on this repo.

## Installation Instructions

### Installation

Currently there are up-to-date instructions for installing a dev instance of xBrowse on your MacOSX laptop or desktop.  
See: [deploy/mac_osx/README.md](deploy/mac_osx/README.md)

We are also very close to completing (as of 2/5/2015) the code for a puppet-based automated deployment of xbrowse to a  vagrant virtual machine, or to an Amazon EC2 server.
