xBrowse
=======

xBrowse is a software package for working with next generation sequencing data,
specifically in the context of studying rare genetic diseases.

This package contains the analysis code that powers the [xBrowse web app](http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xbrowse).
You can use this code to run the xBrowse analyses on the command line, if websites aren't your thing.

We will soon be adding all of the website code to this repository as well -
we are running through some security audits first.
Our goal is to make it easy for you to set up a private instance of xBrowse on your own infrastructure.

**Please Note:** This package is in active development, and the API is extremely unstable -
actually volatile is probably a better description.
For example, I have been constantly reorganizing the code.
