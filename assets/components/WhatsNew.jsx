                - For projects that were sequenced at the Broad Institute, we have access to the underlying sequencing read data (.bam files) and will now
                be able to show an IGV-like view of the reads directly in the browser. This view will be accessible through a <sup><a class="view-reads">

                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> When a variant falls in a gene that has multiple transcript isoforms, seqr selects only one of these transcripts
                to show in variant search results. The choice of transcript may affect things like whether the variant is labeled missense or splice-disrupting, as well as 'HGVSp' and other annotations.<br/>
                Before this update, seqr always chose the worst-affected transcript, but this sometimes led to obscure transcripts being shown for important disease genes. <br/>
                To avoid this, we've updated the transcript selection logic to:<br/>
                - ignore non-protein-coding transcripts (except when all transcripts for a given gene are non-protein-coding).<br/>
                - of the remaining transcripts, select the worst-affected transcripts for the given variant.<br/>
                - if there's a tie where multiple transcripts are worst-affected in the same way, see if any of them is canonical according to Gencode v19.
                If yes, use the canonical transcript. Otherwise, chose by alphabetical order of the transcript id.<br/>
                <br/>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> For De Novo Dominant variant searches on families that have data for mother, father and child,
                    more stringent filters are now applied as follows. A variant will only be shown if:<br/>
                    1) the read coverage in the child is no less than 10% of the total read coverage in the parents at the variant site<br/>
                    2) the variant GQ score is >= 20 in the child<br/>
                    3) the parents' variant call allele balance (number of reads supporting alt allele / total reads ) is less than 5%<br/>
                    - in this case, the setting from the adjustable Allele Balance slider is still applied, but only to the child, while the GQ slider value only applies to the parents.

                        brings up a popup dialog with all transcripts listed. After this update, the popup dialog will now show which of the transcripts
                        is canonical, and also the HGVSp for each.<br/>
