# Placeholder for google service account key 

# If provided, it is used to authenticate gcloud and gsutils command-line tools within seqr and pipeline-runner pods.
# It's also used within the pipeline-runner component when loading data into elasticsearch to allow the spark/hail loading pipeline to directly 
# access reference data files in public google buckets (gs://seqr-reference-data) via the Cloud Storage connector without having to download them first.

# To create this key file, see instructions @ https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/install-storage-connector

#  1) Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
#  2) In the "Create credentials" drop-down, select "Service account key"
#  3) Select "Compute Engine default service account" and Key type "JSON"

# This key will be used as described in https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account
