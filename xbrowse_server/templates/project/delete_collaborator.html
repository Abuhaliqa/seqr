    <p>Are you sure you want to delete the following collaborator: </p>
    <p><strong>{{ project_collaborator.user.profile }}</strong></p>
    <p>
        They will still have their user account and be able to log in, but won't be able to access this project anymore.
        Also note that no data will be lost - their saved variants will still appear.
        This is mostly for when one of your collaborators switches jobs or something.
