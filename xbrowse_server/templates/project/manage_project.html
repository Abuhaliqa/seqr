    <p>
        In xBrowse, users are assigned to a project as a <em>Collaborator</em> or a <em>Manager</em>.
        A collaborator can run any analysis and save variants.
        A manager can do all these things, and also has permission to edit sample data and add new users.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many projects, it makes sense to assign everybody as a manager - that's totally fine.
        For larger projects, the cost of accidentally deleting half of the samples is higher,
        so it often helps to assign only a few managers and funnel all sensitive changes through them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Development Note:</em> We are considering moving to a more granular permissions model.
        If you have any thoughts on a better way to organize data access and management, please get in touch!

        This page lists all the different administrative tasks you can do as a manager. (The page names are links)

<div class="container">
    <a class="sec-header-link" href="{% url 'project_settings' project.project_id %}">Edit Project Settings</a>
    <p>
        Edit the settings for this project.
        Includes basic settings, like the name of the project, and also some project-specific data like gene lists.
        This page is accessible to anybody, but the management links only show up if you are a manager.
    </p>

    <a class="sec-header-link" href="{% url 'project_collaborators' project.project_id %}">Edit Collaborators</a>
    <p>
        Set who is a collaborator on this project and whether they are a manager or not.
        Can also add new people that aren't already on xBrowse.
    </p>

    <a class="sec-header-link" href="{% url 'edit_individuals' project.project_id %}">Edit Individuals</a>
    <p>
        Edit phenotypes and pedigrees for all the individuals in this project (and add and delete individuals).
        This is the most dangerous management page - it has buttons like "Select All" and "Delete Selected" that can be combined in dangerous ways.
